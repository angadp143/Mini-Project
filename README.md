# Snake Game üêç

A classic Snake game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring sound effects, scoring, and a high score tracking system. Eat food, grow the snake, and avoid collisions with the wall or yourself. 

## Demo

You can play the game [here](https://snake-game-angad.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Responsive Controls**: Use arrow keys to move the snake in four directions.
- **Score Tracking**: Score increases with each piece of food eaten.
- **High Score**: High score saved using `localStorage` to retain data across sessions.
- **Sound Effects**: Unique sounds for eating food, game over, and movements.
- **Realistic Game Over Condition**: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with itself.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angadp143/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:

   ```bash

## How to Play
